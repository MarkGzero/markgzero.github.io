Hi. I'm Mark.

I'm a tinkerer, sometimes destroyer, life-long learner, interested in automation, PowerShell, elegant design, and fascinating technologies. The more clever the better.

Whether I'm scripting system administration tasks with PowerShell, tinkering with circuits and microcontrollers, designing and printing practical 3D objects, taking apart old electronics, or exploring random and wide-ranging topics, I'm always trying to learn something new.

This blog is where I share what I've discovered along the way — practical tips, deep dives into tools and technologies, elegant design, and solutions to problems that maybe you're facing too.

If it's technical, interesting, and I think worth learning about, I'll try to blog about it. 

## Let's Connect

I love connecting with fellow tech enthusiasts, learners, and builders. Feel free to reach out, share feedback, or just chat about technology!
