I'm a system administrator, tinkerer, sometimes destroyer, life-long learner, interested in automation, PowerShell, and fascinating design and technologies. The more clever the better.

Whether I'm scripting system administration tasks (mostly Windows), tinkering with circuits and microcontrollers, taking apart old electronics, or exploring the latest news in various STEM fields, I'm always trying to learn something new.

This blog is where I share what I've discovered along the way —- practical tips, deep dives into tools and technologies, and solutions to problems that maybe you're facing too. 

If it's technical, interesting, and I think worth learning about, I'll try to blog about it. 

Let's connect and make technology work for us!
